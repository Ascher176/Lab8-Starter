Service Workers can be used as a step in graceful degradation process. Graceful degradation is a principle of designing software when everything is fully built first assuming good conditions, and then alternative approaches are created to ensure that software still performs its functions under unexpected conditions like bad connection, different older version of the browser or device etc. Service Workers allow us to create some offline capabilities, so it is one of those alternative mechanisms we can add in graceful degradation process as it helps us ensure that our piece of software remains functional under bad connection.
